# Intersection Of Two Arrays2

## Problem Type

Data structures

## Solution description

My solution was to load all the numbers in the first vector into a map with the number of times they occur, then iterate through the second vector and maintain a count of the number of intersections. Then, iterate through the map and write all the intersected numbers to a vector
